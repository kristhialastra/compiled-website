				<h2 class="aboutb">Greetings!</h2>
				<p>Welcome to my website, which serves as my midterm examination for the subject Web Systems Technology (EIT 0123.1-1) under the guidance of Ms. Jamillah S. Guialil. </p>
				<p>On this website, you will find an "About Me" section where I have provided a glimpse of my life goals, education, hobbies, experiences, and skills.
				   Additionally, you will also find an "Activity" tab where you can view and use a simple functional calculator that I developed as part of a school activity.</p> 
				<p>I have put a lot of time and effort into creating this website therefore I am looking forward to sharing this website and displaying my newfound coding skills. I hope it will give an idea of my abilities and interests.</p>
				<p> Thank you for being here!</p>

				<p>Here, you will find a cute and functional calculator that I developed as part of an activity. This calculator not only performs basic arithmetic operations but also comes with delightful popping sounds to add to your experience.

I hope that you enjoy using this calculator as much as I enjoyed creating it, give it a try!</p>

				<h2 class="aboutb">Dive deep and reflect ~</h2>

				<p>As a freshman student with no IT background or prior experience in web development, my experience in the Web Systems Technology
					subject has been both challenging and exciting. During this semester, I have been introduced to the basic concepts of web
					development, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I have learned how to build a website from scratch.</p>
				<p>One of the most significant challenges I faced was understanding the various programming languages and technologies involved in
					web development. At the beginning, I felt overwhelmed by the sheer number of technologies we were expected to learn, from HTML
					and CSS to JavaScript and PHP. To overcome this challenge, I took a proactive approach to my learning by seeking out additional
					resources outside of the classroom. I watched online tutorials, read books and articles.</p>
				<p>Building a website for the first time was a daunting task, but also a fulfilling experience. One of the biggest challenges I
					faced was learning how to debug errors in my code. When I encountered an error in my code, I often felt overwhelmed and didn't
					know where to start looking for the problem. This was particularly frustrating when I thought I had written the code correctly,
					but the website was not displaying the expected results.</p>
					<p>To overcome this challenge, I learned to break down my code into smaller, more manageable pieces and test each component
						individually. I also made use of debugging tools like the Debug CSS chrome extension and online resources to help me
						identify and resolve issues in my code. Through this process, I gained a better understanding of how code works and how
						to write more efficient and effective code.</p>
				<p>Of course, there have been other challenges along the way (that if I discuss in details will be like an episode of MMK), but
					with the help of my professor and classmates, I feel like I've been able to overcome these challenges and grow as an IT student.</p>
				<p>As we move forward in the semester, I'm excited to continue building on what I've learned so far. I feel like I've just scratched
					the surface of what's possible, and I'm eager to explore more about web development. All in all, I'm really glad we have this
					subject and I feel like it's helped me like my course a bit more, and decreased my desire to shift.	</p>
